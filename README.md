# wikilynx
Wikilynx will be a game abount making the fewest links between wikipedia pages. Eventually, when it is 'done', It will act as a tutorial on how to create a small but fully structured React app.

The app uses webpack for the build process. 

## Installation
- Download the app, and unzip it somewhere nice.
- In your terminal, or command prompt if you are on windows, change directories to this folder.
- Type `npm install` (without quotations)

## Run
- In order to make sure that everything is running smoothly, go to the root directory of the app, and run `npm start` in your console of choice.
- open up the index.html file that you should now find in the public directory.
